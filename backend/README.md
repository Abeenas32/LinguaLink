🚀 LinguaLink — Real-Time Cross-Language Chat

LinguaLink is a real-time chat translation system that lets two people chat naturally in their own languages — even if they don’t understand each other.

The platform automatically translates every message before it reaches the other user, creating a seamless, natural conversation experience.

# 🌍 Main Feature (Core Idea)
+ 🗣️ Real-Time Two-Way Translation

+ Two users with different native languages can chat normally:

+ User 1 (Spain): “hola”
  → Automatically translated & delivered as “hello” to the English user

+ User 2 (England): “hello”
  → Automatically translated & delivered as “hola” to the Spanish user

+ No manual language selection.
+ No delays.
+ No barriers.

LinguaLink handles it instantly.
